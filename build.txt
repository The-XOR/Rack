Clone this repository with git clone https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack.git and cd Rack. Make sure there are no spaces in your absolute path, since this breaks the Makefile-based build system.

Clone submodules.

git submodule update --init --recursive
Build dependencies locally. You may add -j4 (or your number of logical cores) to your make commands to parallelize builds. This may take 15-60 minutes.

make dep
Build Rack. This may take 1-5 minutes.

make
Run Rack.

make run
Building Rack plugins
Complete the Setting up your development environment section.

Plugins can be built in two ways:

Build Rack from source and build plugins in the plugins/ folder. (Recommended for advanced developers.)
Download an official Rack build and Rack-SDK-1.1.2.zip, and build plugins anywhere you like. (Easiest/fastest.)
Download or clone the plugin source code, e.g.

git clone https://github.com/VCVRack/Fundamental.git
Clone the git repo’s submodules.

cd Fundamental
git submodule update --init --recursive
If using the Rack SDK, set the RACK_DIR environment variable by prefixing each of the following commands with RACK_DIR=<Rack SDK dir>.

Build plugin dependencies. (Most plugins don’t require this step.)

make dep
Build the plugin.

make
